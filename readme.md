# FeelBack

## Description
How would it be like if feedback surveys were human-centric and not just only math and statistics? 
We should measure not only a projection of numbers, but also a projection of feelings. 
People should have a better experience of offering feedback, an experience closer to their emotions.

## Scope and benefits

• Revolutionary Idea
